# webServe
## ABOUT
This application will let you create a webserver on localhost and will allow you to select the port that you want to access and the URL of the page that will be loaded when u run the server, this will be then stored into a cache-like file so when you run the program again it will reload your previous activity or create a new activity which then you will be able to access all your activities via the CLI in the program.
